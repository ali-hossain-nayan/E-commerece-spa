This project is a full-stack, responsive E-commerce SPA built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite on the frontend, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript on the backend. 
It features product listing, detail view, cart sidebar with quantity control, and a checkout modalâ€”enhanced with animations and toast notifications. State is managed using React Context. 
The backend serves a REST API with seeded dummy product data. To run locally, clone the repo, set up both frontend and backend folders with npm install, run the backend with ts-node and the frontend 
with npm run dev. Both are deployed  on Render, with the frontend as a static site and the backend as a Node service using environment variables for MongoDB.
